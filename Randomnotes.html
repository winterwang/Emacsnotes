<li><a href="#org077f161">3.1.4. For models that contain two or more factors, rotation is conducted to produce a solution with <b><b>the best simple structure.</b></b></a></li>
<li><a href="#org29c98a3">3.1.5. It is important to emphasize that rotation does not alter the fit of the solution. Rather, factor rotation is a mathematical transformation that is undertaken to foster interpretability by maximizing larger factor loadings closer to one and minimizing smaller factor loadings closer to zero.</a></li>

For instance, the true nature of the variance and relationships among indicators and factors can be masked when these variables have been standardized; when the original matric of variables is expressed in meaningful units, unstandardized estimates more clearly convey the importance or substantive significance of the effects.</a></li>

<li><a href="#org0bbc043">8.2. However, despite this flexibility the extended Cox model is not appropriate when the time-dependent covariates are of endogenous nature. This is because the extended Cox model assume that time-dependent covariates are predictable processes, measured without error, and have their complete path fully specified.</a></li>

<li>Page 4: One common question with this data setup is whether we need to worry about correlated data, since a given subject has multiple observations. The answer is no, we do not. The reason is that this representation is simply a programming trick. The likelihood equations at any time point use only one copy of any subject, the program picks out the correct row of data at each times. There are two exceptions to this rule:</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
In order to estimate the parameters in CFA, the measurement model must be identified. A model is identified if, on the basis of known information (i.e., the variances and covariances in the sample input matrix).
</p>

<p>
In the first and by far the more popular method, the researcher fixes the metric of the latent variable to be the same as one of its indicators "marker or reference indicator".
</p>

<p>
In the seconde method, the variance of the latent variable is fixed to a specific value, usually 1.00. However, this method is used less often than the marker indicator approach. 
</p>

<p>
The former strategy produces an unstandardized solution (in addition to a completely standardized solution), which is useful for several purposes, such as tests of measurement invariance across groups and evaluations of scale reliability.
</p>

<p>
Unlike just-identified models, overidentified models rarely fit the data perfectly (i.e., a perfectly fitting model is one whose parameter estimates recreate the data perfectly). 
</p>

<p>
Specification of a model to have at least 0 df is a necessary but not sufficient condition for indentification.
</p>

<p>
For these and other reasons, methodologists recommend that latent variables be defined by a minimum of three indicators to avoid this possible source of underidentification. 
</p>

<p>
By far, the fitting function most widely used in applied CFA research (and SEM in general) is ML (maximum likelihood). The fitting function that is minimized in ML is:
</p>

<p>
\[
F_{\text{ML}} = ln|S| - ln|\Sigma| + \text{trace}[(S)(\Sigma^{-1})] - p
\]
</p>

<p>
where, \(|S|\) is the determinant of the input variance-covariance matrix, \(|\Sigma|\) is the predicted variance-covariance matrix, \(p\) is the order of the input matrix (i.e. the number of input indicators); and \(ln\) is the natural logarithm.
</p>

<p>
The underlying principle of ML estimation in CFA is to find the model parameter estimates that maximize the probability of observing the available data if the data are collected from the same population again.
</p>

<p>
Some key assumption of ML are that 
</p>

<p>
(1) The sample size is large (asymptotic); 
(2) The indicators have been measured on continuous scales (i.e., approximate interval-level data);
(3) The distribution of the indicators is multivariate normal. 
</p>

<p>
The latter two assumptions apply to indicators of latent variables, not to other observed measures that may exist in the analysis, such as nominal variables that serve as covariates. Although the actual parameter estimates (factor loadings) may not be affected, non-normality in ML analysis can result in biased standard errors (and hence faulty significance tests) and a poorly behaved \(\chi^2\) test of overall model fit. 
</p>

<p>
Thus in the case of non-normal, continuous indicators, it is better to use a different estimator, such as ML with robust standard errors and \(\chi^2\) (MLM) or the MLR estimator in the Mplus program. MLM and MLR provide the same parameter estimates as ML, but both the model \(\chi^2\) and standard errors of the parameter estimates are corrected for non-normality in large samples.

<p>
In CFA models where there are no cross-loading indicators, the complete standardized factor loading can be interpreted as the correlation between the indicator and the factor. Accordingly, squaring the completed standardized factor loading provides the proportion of <b><b>variance of the indicator</b></b> that is explained by the factor &#x2013; that is a communality.

<p>
For example it may be reasonable to assume that the risk of ESRD (end stage renal disease) is a function of the patient's current value of serum creatinine and, conditional on that value, is not related to any previous values. 
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
One special type of time-varying covariate deserves attention. During follow-up certain intervening events may occur which can irreversibly alter the patient's risk of the endpoint of interest. For example, the patient might suffer a stroke or permanently discontinue study medication. The covariates representing these intervening events can only take the value 0 or 1, and an individual's covariate value cannot change from 1 to 0 during the course of the trial. 
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
By accounting for the time-varying nature of the covariates, the result should be an illustration of the expected probability of having had an event, as a function of time, for hypothetical cohorts of patients with constant covariate values over time.

Approach 1. The Final Covariate Value (comes from the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation, HOPE study). This approach is clearly inconsistent with the Cox regression model, since the Cox model makes use of the patients' covariate value at each event time.

With out a difference in likelihood, the posterior probability must have the same value as the prior; the observation has not affected your degree of belief. (P15)
</p>

<p>
Confirmation does not mean proving true and disconfirmation does not mean proving false; confirmation and disconfirmation does mean only that an observation should increase or reduce your confidence that H is true. 
</p>

<p>
Bayesian confirmation and disconfirmation involve comparisons of probabilities; they say nothing about the <b><b>absolute values</b></b> of any probability.
</p>

<p>
likelihoods are often independent of priors. (P18)
</p>

<p>
A central thesis of Bayesianism is: <b><b>no propabilities out without any probabilities in.</b></b> 
</p>

<p>
The effect of assigning equal priors is that all the real work is done by the likelihoods; if the priors are equal, the hypothesis of greatest likelihood must also be the hypothesis that has the greatest posterior probability. 
</p>


<p>
Bayesian philophers often see Bayesianism as analogous to deductive logic in this respect. Deductive logic does not tell you what you should take your premises to be; logic is solely in the business of giving advice on what follows from them. <b><b>So the fact that priors and likelihoods are sometimes subjective is just a fact of life in which we all have to deal.</b></b> 
</p>


<p>
(P37) &#x2026; we just need to recognize that the ordinary words "support" and "favouring" sometimes need to be understood within a Bayesian framework in which it is the probabilities of hypotheses that are under discussion;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
(P43) &#x2026; As simple and familiar as this fact about multiple independent testimonies is, it is important to bear in mind that there is no rule written in Heaven that separate pieces of evidence must be independent.
</p>

<p>
(P48) &#x2026; I said that Bayesians hold that science is in the business of determining which theories are probably true while frequentists hold that this is not at all what science is about. 
</p>

<p>
(P51) Dawkins, Dembski, and Morris have all made the same mistake. It isn't that they have glommed on to the wrong cutoff. The problem is deeper: <b>There is no such cutoff.</b> Probabilistic modus tollens is an incorrect form of inference. 
</p>

<p>
(P52) &#x2026; a central idea in the likelihoodist theory of evidence: judgements about evidential meaning are essentially constrastive. To decide whether an observation is evidence against H, you need to know what the alternative hypotheses are; to test a hypothesis requires testing it against alternatives.

(P57) &#x2026; This is the patterns of reasoning that Sherlock Holmes endorses in <b>The Sign of Four</b> where Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has his hero say that "when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, mush be the truth."
